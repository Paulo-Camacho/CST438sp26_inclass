## Overview
A web application that recommends video games to users based on selected preferences such as genre, platform, and play style. Users can explore games, view details, and receive random recommendations [using a public game API(Free-To-Play)](https://www.freetogame.com/api-doc).

## Introduction

#### What was your role / which stories did you work on
I was responsible for building the landing page after login. I implemented the Random Game suggestion feature, then added a Top 10 Popular Games carousel using LazyRow. I reused our existing API and ViewModel logic to keep architecture consistent, and added Compose UI tests to ensure the features worked correctly. I also managed the README file.

+ What was the biggest challenge?
  + Overcoming the challenge of the .idea folder from getting added to main which would cause issues when pulling and running the app.
+ Why was it a challenge?
  + After multiple attempts of working together, we finally got the .gitignore file to properly ignore .idea and removed it from the repo.
+ Favorite / most interesting part of this project
  + Seeing how everyone was able to accomplish their roles at their own pace instead of comparing them to my own.
+ If you could do it over, what would you change?
  + I would try to coordinate deadlines when an issue should be completed so that we can reduce merge conflicts.
+ What is the most valuable thing you learned?
  + I learned to be more comfortable with using Git. I'm not perfect, but this project helped introduce its concepts.

#### What was your role / which stories did you work on
Carol mostly worked on getting the app to run faster, better, and higher.  She did the best work possible but her contributions were overpowered and not well received by the fans.

+ What was the biggest challenge? 
  + Managing pull requests and merges
+ Why was it a challenge?
  + We were all new to git/github and not everyone followed convention
  + How was the challenge addressed?
  + I went to the TA for help and used ChatGPT and web resources to get more comfortable with git.
+ Favorite / most interesting part of this project
  + Finally getting the IDs from the API calls to store in the ROOM database
+ If you could do it over, what would you change?
  + I would get the ROOM database setup FIRST
+ What is the most valuable thing you learned?
  + Do the work early and document EVERYTHING

## Conclusion

- How successful was the project?
  - We wanted to create an app that will recommend users video games based on different options and provide personal reviews and log past searches.
  - We completed about 90% of the original ideas, then implemented newer ones such as sorting, a carousel of popular game, and a search function.

- What was the largest victory?
  - Feeling a sense of trust between each of us to complete our roles when compared to past group experiences. 
- Final assessment of the project
  - It was fun, informative, and a great learning experience. The project is less about learning to code in an unknown programming language, but instead being about team coordination and building familiarity with Git and GitHub.
